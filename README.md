## Project Description
The main goal is to do a prediction in a business case, providing a Machine Learning model
able to predict the quality of a cookie for Cookie Flea.​
​
## Workflow
​The Workflow was the following:
- Defining problems
- Cleaning Data
- Search the best model
- Predictions based on the best models obtained.
- Further predictions without outliers, to identify if the RMSE improved.
- Documentation of the project and presentation preparation.​
​
## Organization
As we were working through a Zoom Call, the organization was divided on the go and assigning tasks based on best capabilities.

The project was stored on the same GitHub repository, allowing the other members of the team being able to push / pull to keep
everyone updated with the last data.
